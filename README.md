# zr1
test new push to prod
test new push
test new build


this is two projects in one.

1: the health-check app which just gives an url to poke which I hoped would build from the healthcheck/docker-compose

2: a copy of the ReleaseVoteApp to test using their templates which I hoped would build from the vapp/docker-compose file
